REGISTER CONFIG FOR LSM9DS1:

WANT: Activate acc, gyro, and mag and set them up

Pge 19 Datasheet:

Write to  CTRL_REG1_G (10h) to activate both acc and gyr at the same ODR (Output Data Rate), value: ? (Active-low? Active-high?)
Apparently with  CTRL_REG6_XL (20h) PD (Powered-down?) Check Fig. 5 and register table

For mag sensor, set it to continuous-conversion mode, faster? Write to CTRL_REG3_M (22h)
Do I want  magnetic data compensated by temperature? check datasheet for speed, possibly since temp will be variable outdoors\

What sampling rate do acc/gyr/mag use? Check and come back to 3.2 to set Gyro speed regs
